# 👋 Hi, I'm Ondřej Vajda  

## 🌐 About Me
I’m a developer who enjoys building things that actually make sense. I’m learning through real projects and improving step by step, mainly in web development.

Technology is the field where I want to grow long-term. I’m interested not just in coding, but also in how products are built, how they work, and how they can be improved. My goal is simple: master the fundamentals, create useful things, and over time build my own products.

Right now, I’m focused on strengthening my technical skills and building a portfolio that shows what I can do.

## 🚀 Goals  
- Build a strong and meaningful project portfolio
- Develop and launch my own tech products
- Keep improving every day

## 📂 Current Projects
- LocalFlix – a local web app that lets you browse, organize and play your own movie files.
- Small web utilities and mini tools to improve my development skills
