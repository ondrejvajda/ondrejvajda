👋 Hi, I’m Ondřej Vajda

I build useful software and small prototypes.

## About Me
I focus mainly on web and backend development through real projects and practical problem-solving.  
I’m interested in how products are built, improved, and maintained over time.

## Focus
- Build and ship small, useful projects
- Improve fundamentals in web and backend development
- Learn how real systems are designed and maintained

## Current Projects
- **LocalFlix** – a local web app to browse, organize, and play your own movie files
- Small internal tools and experiments focused on improving development workflow
